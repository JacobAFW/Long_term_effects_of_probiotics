# Long term effects of probiotics

Microbiome analyses and supplementary data for a pliot study exploring if differences observed in probiotic-supplemented and non-supplemented infants at discharge persist beyond the first year of life. This work has been divided into two separate papers.


## A validation of at-home infant stool sample collection devices for determining the faecal microbiome.

In this study we present a validation of at-home infant stool sample collection with the OMNIgene® GUT kit. Using 16S rRNA metabarcoding we compared samples stored using the OMNIgene® GUT kit to same samples collected in a standard/sterile collection tube at - 80C for 3 months. We observed the storage comparison to have no significant effect on read depth or microbial composition of samples. The OMNIgene® GUT kit is a reliable option for sampling preterm infants at home.

The DOI will be added when published.


## Exploring colonisation and long-term persistence of species from early life probiotic-prophylaxis on the gut microbiome of preterm infants.

This paper is still a work in progress and will be updated upon submission.
