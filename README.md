# Long term effects of probiotics

Microbiome analyses and supplementary data for a pliot study exploring if differences observed in probiotic-supplemented and non-supplemented infants at discharge persist beyond the first year of life. This work has been divided into two separate papers.


## A validation of at-home infant stool sample collection devices for determining the faecal microbiome.

In this study we present a validation of at-home infant stool sample collection with the OMNIgene® GUT kit. Using 16S rRNA metabarcoding we compared samples stored using the OMNIgene® GUT kit to same samples collected in a standard/sterile collection tube at - 80C for 3 months. We observed the storage comparison to have no significant effect on read depth or microbial composition of samples. The OMNIgene® GUT kit is a reliable option for sampling preterm infants at home.

## Exploring the long-term colonisation and persistence of probiotic-prophylaxis species on the gut microbiome of preterm infants: a pilot study.

This study aimed to observe the long-term impact of probiotic prophylaxis on preterm infants, and further explores the idea of expanding the current probiotic supplementation criteria for preterm infants in Australia. The most premature of infants suffer from a greater burden of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and in North Queensland, Australia, preterm babies born < 32 weeks are supplemented with probiotics to mitigate this risk. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the benefits of probiotic prophyalaxis may extend beyond mitigating NEC. Probiotics may contribute to positive microbial changes in the gut, contributing to greater immunity and health. If this is the case, then expanding the criteria for probitoic use beyond the most preterm may be warranted.

We conducted both a cross-sectional analysis (n=18), at ~18 months of age, and a longitudinal analysis (n=6), from admission to 18 months of the gut microbiome of preterm infants using both shotgun metagenomics and 16S rRNA profiling. We observed that species from the probiotic Infloran®, as well as positive modulatory effects that we previously observed to be associated with supplementation (https://github.com/JacobAFW/SCN_vs_NICU_probiotic_study), do not persist beyond discharge and once prophylaxis has stopped. Despite these findings, acute modulation during probiotic prophylaxis may have long lasting immunological benefits.
